<h1> Computer-Vision-Object-Location-through-Ai-Self-Learning </h1>


Real Time Ai -Self Learning Model ,where user will give an input of an object,and Ai will follow this complete automated process of self Learning-

1 Google Search the images of the object

2 Learn the shape and size of the object and tag objects in the image

3 Make train data from those images

4 Tag/Label the object inside the image

5 Write down all the appropriate annotations and text files required for YOLO Model

6 Edit YOLO YAML file with appropriate configurations

7 Train the images, make inference graph, and then Robot will finally know what “keys” are, so it can open up the Camera and start looking for it
